    """This function splits the trimap into foreground pixels, background pixels and classifies each pixel as known or unknown. 

    Foreground pixels are pixels where the trimap has value 1.0. Background pixels are pixels where the trimap has value 0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    trimap: array_like
        Trimap with shape :math:`h\\times w\\times 1`
    flatten: boolean
